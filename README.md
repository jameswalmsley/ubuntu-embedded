# Ubuntu Embedded

Build an embedded system, based on ubuntu "very quickly"!

## Motivation

Buildroot / Yocto are great and powerful, but most people just want a custom kernel
and a stable rootfs without compiling the world. While Yocto does support build caching etc,
the learning curve and initial complexity is very large.
